This is a personal script I've been using that I thought I would share.

Please look over the script before you run it! It has very little testing done!

I do not gaurentee this to work for everyone, It is created for use on a Windows Server 2022 VM and I have not done alot of testing on any other windows versions.

Feel free to fork this and update it!, I probably won't update this too often.


How to:

Download both files, change the "$KickChannel" and "$DownloadFolder" variable in "Start-Recording.ps1" to your prefrences.

Change the filepath in the batch file to where the "Start-Recording.ps1" script is located.

Run the batch file!


This script will Install the following (if not already installed):

Chrome - Installed with winget

ffmpeg - Installed with winget

NuGet Package manager - Installed Install-PackageProvider

Selenium Modlue - Installed with Install-Module


Again this is just a simple script, feel free to change any code to suit your needs.
